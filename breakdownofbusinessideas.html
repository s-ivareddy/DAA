    <h1><u><b> Detailed Breakdown Of Business Ideas:-</b></u></h1>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><u><b>1. Transportation:</b></u></p>
    <h2 style="font-size: 24px;"><u>Dijkstra:</u></h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">This algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">Works with graphs that have non-negative edge weights.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">Finds the shortest path from a single source to all other nodes.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">Can be used with directed or undirected graphs.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;">In our business case, this algorithm can be used for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;"><u>Institutional Transportation:</u> As the institutions need to travel to all the places and come back to the institution to pick up students. So, here Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to generate the shortest path to pick up students at the required stops.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;"><u>Agricultural and Goods Transportation:</u> In agricultural and goods transportation, they should visit multiple stores, fields, and godowns according to their requirements (sometimes multiple times in a single ride). So, here they can get the shortest path to visit all the places using this algorithm.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;"><u>Local Transportation:</u> They should drop the passengers at selected stops according to the passengers' preferences. So, they can use this algorithm to get the shortest path to drop all the passengers at selected stops. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 24px;"><u>Floyd-Warshall:</u></h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">This is a dynamic programming algorithm.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">It can handle both directed and undirected graphs.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">Works even if the graph has negative edge weights, as long as there are no negative weight cycles.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;">In our business case, this algorithm can be used for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;"><u>Clinical Transportation:</u> In clinical transportation, ambulances should go to the nearest hospital with the shortest possible distance. Floyd-Warshall can be used to get the shortest path.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 20px;"><u>Agricultural and Goods Transportation:</u> In some cases, agricultural and goods transportation involves moving from one point to another selected point without stops. Floyd-Warshall can give them the shortest path to the destination.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Corporate and industrial transport needs both the Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall because there may be intra-city and inter-city transportation according to their requirement as to get and supply goods or transportation for their employees. So, here they need both the algorithms.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Intra-City transportation always follows same path to connect all the places in the city and this path is generated by Dijkstra. They may change their path if there is some issue with road or with any external factors.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Long-Distance Transport(intra city transportation) this includes govt. busses, and trains if their service is between two places with no stops between they can use Floyd-Warshall's algorithm, or if there are stops in between they should use Dijkstra's algorithm, and here itself many of the times they will follow a fixed path which will be derived by Dijkstra or Floyd-Warshall according to the service.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><u><b>2. Infrastructure:</b></u></p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-size: 22px;">Both Energy and Water should be supplied to each house from a single source(one source for a certain place street or area). So, here Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to get the least amount of pipes or wire required to connect each and every house.</li>
      <br>
      <li style="font-size: 22px;">Same as in waste management we need to collect waste and gather that at garbage which is located at outskirts of the city. So, there will be different trucks associated to collect garbage at different areas in city to gather the whole garbage at a single place. So, here we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to collet garbage at each area and to gather that garbage at city outskirts we can use Floyd-Warshall's algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm as well</li>
      <br>
      <li style="font-size: 22px;">Community Infrastructure this includes construction of energy-efficient schools, clinics, and community centers designed with renewable energy, natural lighting, and green roofs. By this information we can create a graph(map) which includes each and every place(or location) which can be used by all the people in the city to know shortest path to travel.</li>
    </ul>
